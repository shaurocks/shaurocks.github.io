            Vaccines go through various phases of development and testing. There are usually three phases to clinical trials, with the last one designed to assess the ability of the product to protect against disease, which is called efficacy. All phases assess safety. The last phase, phase III, are usually conducted in a large number of people, often 10â€™s of thousands.  After that, the vaccine needs to go through a review by the national regulatory authority, who will decide if the vaccine is safe and effective enough to be put on the market, and a policy committee, who will decide how the vaccine should be used.
